Expenses Chart Component - Frontend Mentor

My Frontend Mentor Profile: https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/AthenasCode

I'm using Frontend Mentor to practice coding and I'm more focused on function than perfecting the design. 

For this project I used React and basic CSS. I tried to focus on commenting out explanations for my code and making the bar chart responsive to changes in the amounts.
